Hard (5 questions):- 


46.Given two lists of possibly different lengths, a = [1,3,5,7] and b = [2,4,6], merge them
into a single list by alternating elements (start with a[0]) using only for loops and
indexing. If one list runs out, append the remaining elements of the longer list.

47. Given a 4x4 matrix represented as a flat list m =
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16], use nested for loops to rotate the matrix 90
degrees clockwise and print the rotated matrix as rows.

48.Given a list of integers nums, use for loops to find the longest contiguous
subsequence whose elements form an increasing sequence and print its length and
elements. (Implement scanning logic with for loops and indexing.)

49. Given list nums = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19], using only for loops, find and print all pairs
(i, j) where i<j and nums[i] + nums[j] is a prime number.

50.Given a string of digits s = '121332441' using for loops only, find and print the
length of the longest palindrome substring that is centered at any single character (odd-
length palindromes).
