1. Write a program to print all natural numbers from 1 to n. using while
loop

2. Write a program to print all natural numbers in reverse (from n to 1). 
using while loop

3. Write a program to print all alphabets from a to z using while loop

4. Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 to 100. – using
while loop

5. Write a program to find the sum of all odd numbers between 1 to n.

6. Write a program to count the number of digits in a number.

7. Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number.

8. Write a program to find the first and last digit of a number.

9. Write a program to find the sum of first and last digit of a number.

10.Write a program to enter a number and print its reverse.

11.Write a program to find the power of a number using for loop.

12.Write a program to find all factors of a number.

13.Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number.

14.Write a program to find LCM of two numbers.

15.Write a program to check whether a number is Prime number or not.

16.Write a program to print all Prime numbers between 1 to n.

17.Write a program to find all prime factors of a number.

18.Write a program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or
not.
a. An Armstrong number is a n-digit number that is equal to the sum
of the nth power of its digits. For example –
6 = 61 = 6
371 = 33 + 73 + 13 = 371


19.Write a program to check whether a number is Strong number or not
a. Strong number is a special number whose sum of factorial digits is
equal to the original number.
For example: 145 is a strong number. Since, 1! + 4! + 5! = 145

20.Write a program to check whether a number is perfect number or not
a. Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of
its proper positive divisors.
For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number.

21.Write a program to print fibonacci series upto n terms
a. Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where the current number
is the sum of the previous two terms. For Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, 21, ... , (n-1th + n-2th)

22.Write a program to find ones complement of a binary number
a. One's complement of a binary number is defined as value
obtained by inverting all binary bits. It is the result of swapping all
1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s.
