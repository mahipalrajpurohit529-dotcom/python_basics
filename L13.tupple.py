# tupple is immutable 
# tuples are made with paranthesis()
# tupples are faster than list 

# mytuple=(10,20,4)
# print(type(mytuple))

# we can use the index in tupple and access the value but we cant update tupple
# tupples are immutable and we cant use insert,extend,pop,append or anything

# there are only two functions for tupple
#1.count :- counts the number of times an element appears
# a=(20,10,20)
# print(a.count(20))
#2.index :- shows the index of an element
