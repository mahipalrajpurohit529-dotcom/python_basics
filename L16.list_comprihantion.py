# list comprihantion

# it is a comrihansive/simpler way to make a list 
# its nothing but just a simpler way to make a list
# if the code is complex then dont use it

# list comprihansion is faster than list

list=[i for i in range (0,11)]
print(list)

# we can apply arithematic operations on i
list=[i+4 for i in range (0,11)]
print(list)


# we can also use if  else on i
list=[i for i in range (0,11) if i%2==0]
print(list)



# dictionary comprihantion
# can be used when the values of all keys are same and all the keys can be written in loops


mydict = {i:"hey" for i in range (10,16)}
# this will make a dictionary with keys 10 to 15 with each value as "hey"
